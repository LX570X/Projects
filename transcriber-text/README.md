Flask web app

Record (via your browser) 
Auto-detect the spoken language and transcribe it using OpenAI’s Whisper model
Translate that transcript into any of several target languages with googletrans
Generate speech from both the raw transcript and the translation using gTTS
Play back those MP3s in your browser

Frontend:
Uses the MediaRecorder API to capture audio, or an <input type="file"> for uploads.


Flask endpoint (/):
1.	Saves the incoming file to uploads/
2.	Calls whisper.load_model("medium") → model.transcribe(..., language=None)
    Whisper auto-detects the language and returns both text and language.
3.	Uses gTTS to generate transcript.mp3 in static/output/.
4.	If a translation is requested, uses googletrans (with src=detected_language) and then gTTS again to create translation.mp3.
5.	Renders index.html, passing in the raw text, translations, and URLs for the two audio files.
